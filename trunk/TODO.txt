Things that need to be done before a 0.3 release

- update README to reflect 'activation' changes
- write more tests!
- create migration profile
  - figure out proper way to deprecate the content type
  - migrate ChildFolders to basic folders that are marked
  - migrate permission (remove old permission in rolemap.xml)
  - remove child site type by running migration profile after switching out folders
- Finish up uninstall profile
- Finish up subscribers for site deletion
- re-enable child site creation permission
- Large Folder child site?  normal AT folder?  plone.app.content container?

complimentary products:

- wrote exportimport for p4a.subtyper, working on gaining commit access
- support child site properties, wrote collective.proxyproperties and lineage.proxyprops to support this
- support theming (currently the claytron branch of themetweaker.themeswitcher, needs to be merged down to trunk)
