Installation Instructions
=========================

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can add ``collective.lineage``
to your instance part::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
      Plone
      collective.lineage
    zcml =
      collective.lineage

Currently this code depends on `PLIP 234`_ which should become a part
of Plone 3.3.  If you want to use it now you can add the branches
of the eggs for the plip::

    [buildout]
    parts =
      ...
      plip234-branches
    
    [plip234-branches]
    recipe = infrae.subversion
    location = plip234-branches
    as_eggs = true
    urls =
      http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/Plone/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes Plone
      http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.layout/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.layout
      http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.app.portlets/branches/calvinhp-inavigationroot-fixes plone.app.portlets

Now you can re-run your buildout to get the all the dependencies::

    $ ./bin/buildout

Once your buildout is finished you can start up your instance and install Lineage via the ``Add-on Products`` configlet in site setup.
