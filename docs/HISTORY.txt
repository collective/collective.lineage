Changelog
=========

0.3 - (XXXX-XX-XX)
------------------

- Moving over to an 'activation' based system instead of having a
  'Child Folder' type.  Now a folder will have the option for a
  subtype named 'Child Site'.

  http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/1
  [claytron]

- Remove 'Child Folder' add/edit interfaces.  The type still remains
  so that we can do a migration.
  [claytron]

- Added uninstall profile and hooked it up to the Quickinstaller
  [claytron]

- Added subtyper.xml to the uninstall profile that will deactivate
  all 'Child Sites' in the portal.  This depends on p4a.subtyper
  code that has not yet been released.  This also solves the
  export/import issue
  http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage/issues/2
  [claytron]

- Added a subscriber to create the local component site (this was
  in the 'Child Folder' type before)
